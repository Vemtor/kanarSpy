# kanarSpy
The kanarSpy app warns you about ticket controls in the city of Krak√≥w. Upon entering the server, you can see the latest ticket controls. To report a control, simply click on the map and fill out the form. The frontend is primarily composed of JavaScript and HTML supporting an open-source map. For the backend, I used Java along with the Spring framework and Hibernate. The database server is based on MySQL.
